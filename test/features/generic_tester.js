    The test data (fixtures) is imported by generic-fake-es-tester to
    run the tests and fake-es to test the FeatureService's esQuery and
    return the esResult to FeatureService.

    Fixture structure and how it is used in test / fake-es:
    {
        describe: 'The test description for pretty printing',
        fsEndpoint: 'The endpoint that is supposed to request this data',
        expectedEsQuery: "The Elasticsearch query FeatureService is expected to send",
        esResult: "The response of Elasticsearch to this query"
        makeFsRes: "The makes the expected result of FeatureService"
    }

    The Test data flow:

    1] test_file(this file) ---> sends get to FS at fsEndpoint
    2] FS builds esQuery                 ---> fake-es [esQuery === expectedEsQuery]
    3] fake-es returns druidResult       ---> FS
    4] FS returns fsResult              ---> test_file [fsResult === expectedFsResult]

    To add more tests, you need to :
    1) add a test data file in "module to test"/fixtures.js
    2) import new fixtures in this file and in fake-es.js, i.e. add each new
        fixture to the fixture array
